# Extended sensitivity curves for extended IFU spectra

These files provide sensitivity curves for NIRSpec IFU spectra extended into regions where orders can overlap, analagous to those derived for MSA spectra in ``msaexp/data/extended_sensitivity``.

These files are designed to be used with data that has been calibrated with the S-Flat reference files provided at [https://s3.amazonaws.com/msaexp-nirspec/ifu-sflat/index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/msaexp-nirspec/ifu-sflat/index.html).

The M-grating curves include estimates of the relative sensitivities of the 2nd and 3rd orders.

**NB**: The order separation has not yet been computed for G140M + F070LP.
